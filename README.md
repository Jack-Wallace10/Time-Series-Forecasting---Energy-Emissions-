# Time Series Forecasting: Energy Consumption

## Project Overview

This project explores energy consumption forecasting through an analysis of historical data using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to better understand the patterns and trends in energy demand over time, using this analysis to develop more accurate forecasts. These insights could be useful for various applications, including energy management and planning.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains hourly energy consumption data (`PJME_MW`) from the PJM East region, spanning several years. This dataset serves as the foundation for building forecasting models, and the analysis provides insights into daily, weekly, and seasonal energy consumption trends.

## Methodology

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loaded and cleaned the time series data.
   - Handled missing values and engineered time-based features such as hour, day of week, and month to improve the model's predictive capabilities.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized energy consumption trends at different time intervals (hourly, daily, monthly) to understand underlying patterns.
   - Analyzed seasonal peaks and troughs in energy demand, identifying factors like time of day and seasonality as key drivers.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Built an XGBoost regression model to forecast energy consumption.
   - Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics such as R², RMSE, and MSE.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Visualized predicted vs actual energy consumption to assess model accuracy and identify areas for improvement, particularly in low and high consumption periods.

## Key Findings

- **Seasonal and Daily Trends**: The analysis uncovered clear daily patterns, with energy consumption peaking during the afternoon hours and decreasing overnight. Additionally, seasonal patterns were identified, with higher demand during summer and winter months due to cooling and heating needs.
- **Model Performance**: The model was able to capture the overall cyclical nature of energy consumption, with good accuracy in forecasting short-term fluctuations and long-term seasonal trends.

## Next Steps

Future directions for this project include:
- **Feature Expansion**: Incorporating external factors like weather data to improve forecasting accuracy.
- **Model Optimization**: Further tuning the model to reduce errors during peak demand and low consumption periods.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an initial exploration of energy consumption trends and the potential of machine learning models for time series forecasting. The insights gained from this analysis can help inform energy management decisions and further research into more advanced forecasting techniques.
