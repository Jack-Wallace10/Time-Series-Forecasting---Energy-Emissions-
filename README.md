# Time Series Forecasting: Energy Consumption

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to forecast energy consumption over time. The main objective is to improve energy management and inform decision-making processes, particularly in the energy trading sector. Accurate predictions of energy demand can help anticipate price movements, reduce trading risks, and optimize energy trading strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains energy consumption data (`PJME_MW`) with hourly records. The data spans several years and is used to train, validate, and test the model's forecasting capabilities.

## Methodology

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading and cleaning the time series data.
   - Handling missing values and resampling the data to maintain consistency.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Development of a historical prediction model using machine learning techniques.
   - Evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance on different time granularities such as yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily forecasts.
   
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Visualization of the model's predictions versus the actual energy consumption data to assess its accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Forecasting**: The model demonstrates a strong fit to historical data, showing accurate forecasts at different time intervals (yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily).
- **Energy Trading**: The model's predictions support energy trading strategies by providing more accurate demand forecasts, potentially reducing trading risks and optimizing contract pricing.

## Next Steps

The project aims to extend the model's capabilities by incorporating energy pricing forecasts to support more informed buying and selling decisions based on predicted demand. This is currently a work in progress.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in forecasting energy consumption, providing valuable insights for energy trading and management. Future improvements include incorporating pricing models for more comprehensive decision-making support in energy trading.
